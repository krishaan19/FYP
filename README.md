Optimisation of a multi-integrated energy system for a smart city
This project focuses on the optimisation of a multi-integrated energy system tailored for a smart city environment. It leverages real-world solar and wind data to model and simulate the operation of distributed energy resources, including photovoltaic systems, wind turbines, battery storage, and electric vehicles. Using Pyomo and Gurobi, the model evaluates cost and emission trade-offs under various scenarios. The following pytho scripts include the models used for the different scenarios.
